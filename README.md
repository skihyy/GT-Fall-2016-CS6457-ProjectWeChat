# Story

In the search for immortality extensive research was performed. While on the verge of a breakthrough, a critical error was made and the worst case scenario came about. You are patient 0, the failed test subject. You no longer age, but you have lost all reason and are driven by a never ending need to feed. Seek out other humans to satiate your hunger and spread the “gift” of immortality. 

# Mechanics

● Player play as a zombie to hunt down all citizens.  
● Citizen can be infected and turn into a zombie.  
● Soldiers will come later and try to eliminate all of the zombies (including the player of course).  
● Remaining citizens would run to soldiers to get rescued.  
● Player should run away from the soldiers and try to survive.  
● Exit gate will open later. The player needs to reach the gate to win.  

# Rules
